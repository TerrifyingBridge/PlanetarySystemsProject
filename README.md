# PlanetarySystemsProject
I bought a book a while ago called "Dynamics of Planetary Systems" by Scott Tremaine. This project is my attempt at finding a new coding project for each section or two. my goal with this is to increase my coding skills and also work on astrophysics (since I'm pretty rusty).
