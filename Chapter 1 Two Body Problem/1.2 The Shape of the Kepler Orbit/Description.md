# Section 1.2 - The Shape of the Kepler Orbit
This section, as you might have guessed, outlines what the different types of Kepler Orbits look like. The section starts off with using the acceleration derivative of $\mathbf{r}$ (as it's more commonly seen, $\mathbf{\ddot{r}}$) in polar coordinates to derive some basic relations to energy and angular momentum. This then transitions into finding the periapsis and apoapsis. With all of this under our belt, the section transitions into solving the equation of motion that satisfy the differential equation, and ends the section talking about the different cases, and what they look like.

As last time, I will first go through some self imposed exercises that I thought would be interesting / benifical to work through, then later talk about the project I specifically worked on. On an unrelated note, you will notice that I'm using different vectors than for the previous section. This is because a friend of mine looked at the notation I was using and absolutely hated it. Thus, I have changed to the notation used in this file here. I am not going back to change the old file (something about seeing growth blah blah blah).
