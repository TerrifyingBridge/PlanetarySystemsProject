# Section 1.5 - Units and Reference Frames
This section briefly goes over the various units and reference frames that we use when observing the universe / solar system. The book starts off by talking about how we keep track of time in astronomy, then transitions into talking about how we measure distance. During this moment, the book also gives background as to why the units are what they are. The book finishes this section by talking about the reference frame we use for a coordinate system when talking about other objects in the universe.

Due to how small this section ended up being, along with the general content, there will be no self imposed exercises for this section. The section was mostly general justification for the units as well as what they are, and I couldn't figure out a good idea for what to do. I figure that instead of bashing my head against a wall trying to figure out what to do, I would just move on since the later sections of this chapter are a lot more intense.
