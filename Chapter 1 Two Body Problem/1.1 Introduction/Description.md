# Section 1.1 - Introduction
This particular section focuses on a basic outline of celestial mechanics. Like very basic. The extent of this section talks about the acceleration for a simple 2-body problem and looks at the immediate consequence of this. They mention conversation of energy and momentum, and simplifies it down to a 1-body problem. Outside of that, there isn't too much going on.
## Self Imposed Exercises
Since this is the first descriptiong, I'll explain what I plan on doing here. This book jumps over a couple of concepts it deems as too simple to emphasize (at least I think, it's not an intro book, so I don't blame Scott for not focusing on stuff like conversation of energy), so it skips them. Part of this project is to re-learn these concepts (and learn some LaTeX), so I'll choose a couple derivations or explanations to get practice with this.

Onto the general description of what I am going to do, of which there are three: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of energy, and simplification to a 1-body problem. None of these should be too difficult, just a lot of grinding algebra and vector operations.

### Conversation of Angular Momentum
Honestly, this one is kind of cheating, since *technically* the section shows conversation of the relative angular momentum. But I'm going to show it for the 2-body system. To start off, let's get some basic definitions. The book gives us the following equation.

$$ L_{tot}  = m_{0} \textbf{r}_{0}$$
