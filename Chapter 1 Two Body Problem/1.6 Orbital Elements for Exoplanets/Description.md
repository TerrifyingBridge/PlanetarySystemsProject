# Section 1.6 - Orbital Elements for Exoplanets
This section focuses on exoplanets, and what orbital elements that we can find using the different methods of exoplanet detection. Each method of detection has a rather detailed explanation about what information is given using observations and provides a small bit of background when it comes to trying to find exoplanets in the first place. In addition to this, there is also mention of the limitations of each method and what we cannot detect or measure. The book goes over four different methods for exoplanet detection: radial velocity method, transiting planet method, astrometry method, and direct imaging method. Graviational microlensing is mentioned as a method but not focused on in this section as it doesn't provide us many constraints for the orbital elements for the exoplanets.

## Self Imposed Exercises
When first reading this section, the parts that confused me the most were the astrometry and direct imaging coeffients, as they are mostly just stated. Assuming you can determine the wobble of a star or directly observe a planet, you can fit them the equations given and find a best value for A, B, F, and G. From there it's a matter of solving for the orbital elements once you have them. However, I wasn't sure where these coefficents come from, so I figured it that was a good place to start when it came to the self imposed challenges. For this particlar part of the file, I'll go through both the astrometry coeffients as well as the direct imaging coefficents.

### Section 1.6 Thoughts
This section was a lot more digestable to get through than most of the previous sections, although I am slowly coming to the conclusion that I it is me warming up to the material. I do think I was a bit harsh in the beginning when I mentioned that there were jumps in the book, because these jumps would have been trivial to those who already know and have retained a lot of physics information. As someone who has been teaching computer science for 3 years and hasn't been in a physics class in 4 years, the start (I believe) was me being rather rusty, and I believe that this section showcases that well.

I believe that this section is probably the more conceptually difficult section, but it was easy to digest and following what was happening in each subsection of the book. The only part that lost me was the astrometry coefficents, and this was more so because there was a lot of stuff in those coefficents rather than me getting stuck on why they were what they were. Truthfully, I don't have too many interesting things to say about this section because of how straightforward it was to read and understand. I did enjoy this section a lot, as I'm really interested in exoplanet research as well as their general dynamics (hence why I have this book), so I was really excited to get to this moment. Overall, it was a fun chapter, and I look forward to many more to come.
