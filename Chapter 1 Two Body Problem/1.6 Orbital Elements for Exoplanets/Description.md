# Section 1.6 - Orbital Elements for Exoplanets
This section focuses on exoplanets, and what orbital elements that we can find using the different methods of exoplanet detection. Each method of detection has a rather detailed explanation about what information is given using observations and provides a small bit of background when it comes to trying to find exoplanets in the first place. In addition to this, there is also mention of the limitations of each method and what we cannot detect or measure. The book goes over four different methods for exoplanet detection: radial velocity method, transiting planet method, astrometry method, and direct imaging method. Graviational microlensing is mentioned as a method but not focused on in this section as it doesn't provide us many constraints for the orbital elements for the exoplanets.
