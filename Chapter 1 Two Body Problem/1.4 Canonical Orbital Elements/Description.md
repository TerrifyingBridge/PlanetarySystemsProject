# Section 1.4 - Canonical Orbital Elements
This section introduces the Hamiltonian for Kepler orbits and talks about the results of doing so. Since many standard coordinate systems aren't the best when dealing with the average orbit, this section focuses on using the hamiltonian to use other canoical coordinates to work with that make understanding certain asepcts of orbits much simplier. Most of this section talks about the different types of canoical coordinates that can be used and their different generating functions. However, there are only two different named canoical coordinate pairs, and they are the Delaunay variables and the Poincar√© variables. This book goes into a bit more detail surrounding some of these canonical coordinates (such as their consequence on the hamiltonian and some extra definitions for new terms), but for the most part, this is majority of the section.

| Subsection of Document | Description of Subsection |
| -----------------------|---------------------------|
| [Self Imposed Exercises](#self-imposed-exercises) | This section focuses on any exercises I thought would be helpful or fun to participate in, most of which I make for myself. |
| [Project Description](#project-description) | This section focuses on the description of the coding project for this part of the book, as well as relevant information I use from the book. |
| [Concluding Thoughts](#concluding-thoughts) | This section focuses on my reflection after completing the different stages for each section. I go into detail about my commentary for the book section, the self imposed exercises, and my project |

## Self Imposed Exercises
Since most of this section was focusing on canonical coordinates using the orbital elements, there wasn't too much that was left as an exercise to the reader.
